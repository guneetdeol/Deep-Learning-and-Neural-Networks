# Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Networks
Repo for deeplearning.ai certification on coursera
#### Planer data Classification :
this notebook would allow one to:
    - Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
    - Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
    - Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
#### Building a deep neural network: step-by-step :
In this notebook we will: 
    - Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
    -Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.
    - Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
