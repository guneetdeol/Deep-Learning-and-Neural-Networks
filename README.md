# Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Networks
Repo for deeplearning.ai certification on coursera
#### Planer data Classification :
This notebook would allow one to:
    - Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
    - Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
    - Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
#### Building a deep neural network: step-by-step :
In this notebook we will:
    - Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
    -Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and           ease the process of building a neural network.
    - Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
#### Deep Neural Network - Application:
This notebook allows us to:
   - Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.
   - Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.
   - Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
